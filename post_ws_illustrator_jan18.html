Pamela Martello is going to take you through this amazing tool from start to finish. She'll share with you her knowledge and tricks of 9 years of experience with Illustrator. </p>
    <p>
In this intensive workshop, you will start by getting familiarized with Illustrator, gradually move on to learning how to use its main tools and features, and then get a 2-dimensional design of your own to the finish line. In addition to Illustrator, you will also learn how to integrate your newly acquired vector design skills with Xinfab’s laser cutter and bring your prototypes to life.  No previous knowledge is required!</p>
        <p>
Adobe Illustrator is the design industry’s standard for creating vector graphics. With it, you can design posters, business cards, banners, logos, websites – in sum, you can illustrate anything you want!  By combining it with the laser cutter, you can also create 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional objects – the only limit is your imagination!</p>
            <p>
Your dedication is key. We invite you to practice after the lessons with some homework and maximize your takeaway from the course.</p>
      <p>No previous Illustrator knowledge is needed, but <b>you do need to be familiar with how to use a computer</b> (in other words, Windows or iOS don't scare you and you understand basic commands like Ctrl C+Ctrl V).</p>
<p>
<b>Price includes:</b><br />
    // One month Xinfab Membership for you to DIY! (180 RMB worth of credits for machine usage within a month); Material for prototyping
</p>
<p>
<b>Things you should bring:</b><br />
// Your laptop and charger<br />
// Mouse (this workshop can’t be followed without a mouse)<br />
// Install Illustrator CC in your laptop (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/illustrator" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/illustrator</a>)<br />
// Your passion, curiosity, and questions</p>
      <br />

          <b>ABOUT THE TEACHER</b></p>
      <p><img src="photos/staff/pamela_small.jpg" /></p>
           <p>
               <B>Pamela Martello</B> is a Mexican jewelry designer who has been creating original and stylish 3D and 2D designs for the past 9 years. Jewelry is Pamela's true love, but she has a decade-long love affair with graphic design and Illustrator, with which she complements her jewelry creations. </p>
               <p>
Pamela is a graduate from the European Institute of Design (IED) in Rome, Italy. She entered the IED through the big door, by winning a design competition and being awarded a scholarship. Upon graduating in jewelry design, Pamela took a graphic design specialization, also at the IED. In her career, Pamela has won multiple jewelry and graphic design awards, including an artwork design award for American Express. Pamela has been creating jewelry in Shanghai for the past 4 years.</p><p> 
Last year, Pamela discovered Xinfab and immediately joined our core team as a volunteer. She loves the laser and the 3D printers and is always experimenting in other fields related to design, where she finds inspiration for her creations. She has also taught many workshops with us. For Pamela, travelling, exploring, and living in different places offers a constant stream of stimulus for new ideas (plus a little fantasy too).</p>
